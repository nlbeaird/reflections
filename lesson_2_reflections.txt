what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  You create a subdirectory called .git that will contain the meta data.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is a list of files that are set to be committed, but haven't been yet, it is also a subset of the working directory. It offers the value of making sure you know what is being tracked before you commit a change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  We can check that the staging area isnt that different from the last commit? I'm not so sure about this. You can do git diff and see how different what you are working is to the thing that was last committed.
