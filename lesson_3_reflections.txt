When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  makes sense if you are working on different computers that aren't being synced, or if you are collaborating with someone on a project


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  you might not want to incorporate a commit someone else pushed to the shared project quite yet.
